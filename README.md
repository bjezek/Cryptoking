# bitstamp & Coinbase exchanges
looking at data from two exchanges determining which is a better investment 
and which time of the day would be best to invest in, also whats the risker investment vs reward

# Arbitrage profits early,middle and late day
showing when is the best time to invest and what the daily profits
as well as the cumulative returns showing graphs that display differents in 
trading volume and growth opportunites. 

# early bird gets the worm but lunch is so much better
its clear to me that early trading is profitable but mid trading in the month was much more lucarative 
based on volume and opportunity for growth but you would have made $ during both periods of January to Febuary
and would have missed the boat in March.

# Bitstamp & Coinbase
they seem to be very much in correlation to each other with Coinbase overing a slightly larger
spread with great risk factor making in my opinion Bitstamp the better choice.
